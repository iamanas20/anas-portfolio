# Building Lightfunnels.

> "One of the best e-commerce platforms on the market. Competes with both ClickFunnels and Shopify!"

I started working with the Lightfunnels team before there was anything rendered on the project, that's how early I was to the party. I was the first hire back in November 28th, 2018. It was a surreal moment for me when I was accepted into the team, because I was just freshly-graduated with only about 4 months of after-graduation internship.

I knew from the start that the task in hand was a tremendous challenge and we as a team had to show up everyday to face it. Especially in the beginning, it was a very crazy thing for me to be a part of such an amazing team. Yassir, Yousef, and Naoufal were big mentors for me in the beginning I have (still do) learned so much from them, from management, focus, marketing and most importantly, engineering. I’m incredibly proud of this team.

I’ve started at Lightfunnels as a UI/UX developer, so I've learned about everything related to that area fairly quickly. I've learned from Yassir in particular how to have a great attention to detail, how everything should fall in place to create the most seamless UX designs and workflows for customers. I've learned that a team and a company as a whole should be focused on the customers. They're the ones that make the company work, and the company should work for them.

Making insanely great UI/UX components require a well-structured and effective engineering side. I transitioned to 100% software engineering with the team when Yusuf made the jump to be an amazing addition to the team, he is one of the most talented UI/UX designers I've ever seen, his attention to detail is unmatched. He took over with his experience in building designs for consumer applications. I have started working with React to convert those designs into code and into live components and pages that customers would use. I quickly found out that the learning curve was steeper than I thought, and I was up for the challenge.

After so many components and pages were created, I then started working with tools to help connect the backend with the frontend. Tools like GraphQL, and a custom made Redux-like global state solution. the pages started coming to life and things aren't static anymore. This is one of the best things I've done because it allowed me to understand how data works, how to mutate, how to query, basically, how does backend work for the frontend, and vice-versa. on my own, I started learning about Node, Express, MySQL, JWT, backend GraphQL, and eventually I jumped into cloud technologies and started to learn about AWS. This was a big and necessary growth experience.

What also was a big growth experience for me, was the migration to TypeScript and the migration to Relay. I mentioned that we had a custom-built Redux-like global state management service, we also had a custom-built Apollo-like GraphQL frontend client. These two custom solutions started causing problems as the product was growing in terms of code lines. Especially with the forms, mutations, and data sync. So transitioning to a more scalable and sustainable solution was the right choice and again, big learning curve for me. Always be on the lookout for newer and better technologies and see how you can migrate to them to make your life, and the lives of your teammates easier.

Now Lightfunnels stands as one of the greatest and most feature-packed e-commerce platform on the planet. Looking back after 3 years of exponential growth for myself and the team as a whole. It has and continues to be an honor to be a part of such a talentetd group of people building one of the best if not the best e-commerce platform to sell products online. We could not have done this without every single one of this team, truly amazing to see the platform and think "Wow I was part of this?". Super surreal.

# Why I decided to move to the Netherlands

> If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.

It's been about one year since one family member who visited the Netherlands for a few days have told me about it, how everything is amazing. At that time I didn't pay attention I wanted to spend many more years in Morocco working with amazing people on phenomenal solutions.

The days went by, I started researching everything about the Netherlands through articles, videos, vlogs etc. This gave me a grasp on culture, history, innovation, human rights, safety, government systems, healthcare, people, and daily life. I fell in love with it all.

I met that family member again in October 2021 and I asked him this "What was the best country you've been to?". He said the Netherlands before even finishing the question, he talked a bit why he choose the Netherlands, he spent time in Amsterdam, the capital and biggest city in the Netherlands.

I decided to look for opportunities and move there because honestly, for me, it is hands down the best country on the planet. Whenever you search for "Top countries in ___" you most likely will find the below-sea-level-land up there among the top 10. The culture, the cities, the services, and the people are really great. I want to be a part of it, work hard, contribute, and grow accustomed to life there.

Leaving Morocco and my work wasn't an easy decision, but I had to make it. I made the decision to leave with dignity and do things right. I have nothing but love and respect to my previous team members, I look up to everyone on that team. I had the opportunity to stand on the shoulders of giants, and I took it. I also have nothing but love for Morocco and its people.

I am ready for this new journey, I'm ready to live everyday with the choices I made.
